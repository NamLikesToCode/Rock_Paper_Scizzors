This will be practice on making a Rock Paper Scizzors game using Javascript/Html/css

This is my first practice on using Javascript to make a Rock Paper Scissors game that is played on the console.log.
It is rough but it is great practice for me. 
It works but I need to add more quality of life features to it such as making sure the prompt for playerSelection to be solid.
There is still much to learn but I made good progress with this project so I'm glad.
